Lines that appear outside of defining blocks are considered comments.
A defining block starts with a line with two dashes, a type and a name,
and is ended by a line with two dashes and END.

Universes, graphs, and tests can appear in any order, but the relative
order of tests is kept to ease comparisons.
Names are used as identifiers, and therefore must be non-empty
and unique per type (i.e. a universe, a resolved graph, and a test can share
the same name, but two universes cannot).

The syntax within a defining block follows the syntax of the associated
schemas.

Below is the definition of a universe, named alice.
-- Universe alice
alice
	1.0.0
		bob@1
-- END

Below is the definition of a universe, named bob.
-- Universe bob
bob
	1.0.0
	2.0.0
-- END

Below is the definition of a test. It links two universes, a resolve root, a
graph for the expected resolution, and optionally sets flags.
-- Test alice
Resolve alice 1.0.0
Universe alice, id:bob
Graph alice
Flag flag1 flag2
-- END

Below is the definition of a resolved graph, named alice.
-- Graph alice
alice 1.0.0
└─ bob@1 1.0.0
-- END

Below are the definitions of two Universes alice2 and alice3 that contain the
same alice@1.0.0 version that has a registry attribute.
-- Universe alice2
alice
	1.0.0
		ATTR: Registries dep:bob
-- END

-- Universe alice3
alice
	1.0.0
		ATTR: Registries dep:bob
-- END

Below is the definition of a test that combines two universes that share a
common version
alice2
-- Test alice2
Resolve alice 1.0.0
Universe alice2, a3:alice3
-- END

Below is the definition of a resolved graph, named alice2, without the ASCII art:
alice 1.0.0
└─ bob@1 1.0.0
-- Graph alice2
alice 1.0.0
	bob@1 1.0.0
-- END
